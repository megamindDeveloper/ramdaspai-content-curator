## Core Features:

- Dashboard Display: Display four content options (YouTube, Images, Reels, Screenshots) as distinct sections on the dashboard.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) for a professional and trustworthy feel, referencing the common color schemes in dashboard interfaces.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5), for a clean and unobtrusive backdrop, making content pop.
- Accent color: Bright orange (#FF9800) to highlight CTAs and interactive elements, offering a contrast to the primary blue.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for a clean, modern, and readable interface.
- Use a consistent set of minimalistic icons from a library like FontAwesome, with the accent color (#FF9800) used for interactive elements.
- Implement a grid-based layout to organize the content options, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly experience across different screen sizes.
- Use subtle animations, like fade-in effects when the modal opens, to enhance the user experience without being distracting.
